Copy all the files to your Galactic Unicon using Thonny - edit config.py to add your Wifi and MQTT broker credentials.

Edit the unicornmqttscroller.py file for your own MQTTT to subscribe, background colour, scroll speed etc.

In addition, we have provided a 3D printed case front case for the Unicon - split into two sections for printing on standard print beds.
